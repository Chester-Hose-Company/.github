Welcome to The Chester Hose Company Inc. GitHub! ðŸš’

## About Us

The Chester Hose Company, established in 1912, is a volunteer fire department serving the town of Chester, Connecticut. Located along the west bank of the Connecticut River, we are dedicated to protecting lives and property through our comprehensive fire, rescue, hazmat, and EMS services. Our commitment extends beyond our local community as we strive to support and collaborate with other agencies to enhance day-to-day operations.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to protect the lives and property of those living in and passing through Chester while providing essential fire, rescue, hazmat, and EMS services. In addition to our core operations, we occasionally open source some of our non-critical codebases to support and collaborate with others in the emergency services community.

## What to Expect

Currently, we do not have any software released yet. As we develop and refine our tools, we will make them available here. Our aim is to share resources that may assist other agencies and individuals in their day-to-day operations.
